/**
 * Rate limiting middleware.
 *
 * Two flavours:
 *
 *   - translateLimiter: tight per-user budget on the OpenAI-burning routes
 *     (POST /api/translate, /api/batch, /api/batch/alternatives,
 *     /api/translate/quick, /api/compliance/check, /api/demo/check).
 *
 *   - mutationLimiter: looser per-user budget on the rest of the write
 *     surface (admin endpoints, glossary CRUD, memory create, reviews).
 *     The risk on these is brute-forcing the admin surface, not OpenAI
 *     spend.
 *
 * Keying: req.authUser.id when authenticated, falls back to the trusted
 * client IP (req.ip — honours `trust proxy` settings from Step 6.1).
 * Anonymous requests still get bucketed by IP. Each route is protected by
 * its own auth gate, so unauthenticated callers can't actually hit the
 * counters often, but the IP fallback gives a defence-in-depth answer if
 * something is misconfigured.
 *
 * The standard rate-limit headers are emitted so clients can back off.
 * On limit-hit: 429 with a brief JSON body. We surface the
 * retry-after-seconds value for UI use.
